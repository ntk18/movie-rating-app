# movie-rating-app

## Description
A Maui App where users can rate search for movies, rate them and see all their rated movies. This was done for a class taken my fall semester of senior year at Miami University. Specific class not named at the request of the professor.

This project utilizes [TheMovieDatabaseAPI](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started) for searching for movies and getting all movie details and images.
A local SQLite database is used for storing movie ratings and notes.
